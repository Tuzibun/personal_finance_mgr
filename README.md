Welcome to the Personal Finance Manager

Please follow these steps to set up your program:
1)  Download the entire GitHub repository
2)  In Terminal, type psql (after installing it, if you 
	haven't already) and enter this:

	CREATE DATABASE pfm;
	\c pfm

3)  In your preferred text editor, open account.rb
4)  Find the commented out section beginning on line 7 labeled 
	** HI NEW USER!**
5)  Un-comment out (delete the # at the beginning of each line) 
	lines 9 - 25
6)  In Terminal, press CMD + T for a new tab
7)  Navigate to the folder where you stored the pfm files and 
	run pfm.rb
8)  If you wish to return to the program later, you will need
	to go back to the account.rb file and re-comment out lines
	9 - 25 for your information to persist
9)  If you wish to seed your program to test it, open pfm.rb 
	in your text editor.  Locate and un-comment line 7.
